# Heriga

Heriga is a platform to upload, share, and browse different types of cultural heritage of communities at risk due to human or natural disasters or neglect. Even though its feature set is planned to be broad, it is intended to provide a simple user experience in order to reach out to people of many different backgrounds. It will provide users with a profile, news feed, and filtering options to browse the cultural database.

The platform allows the user to create public or private communities or groups, and inside of these newly created groups, the user can record stories, songs, videos and upload photos and 3D models. Written input can be divided by personal stories, interviews, news, study reports, debates and disclosure of damaged of public or private property. Recording and uploading songs, videos and photos to an entry allows the user to fully document a cultural artefact. This will provide heriga a broad scope to work as a digital archive managed by its users. An interactive map feature will assist users in finding and browsing stories specific to a certain location.

Working as a cultural social network, Heriga is intended to help to: raise awareness regarding cultural heritage topics, such as looting, illegal trade or destruction; to allow users to share solutions regarding preservation; engage communities to get involved in different cultures; and allowing organisations and individuals to add their own cultural artefacts to the Heriga database.

The project would also be open for anyone else to use to record their own heritage. We would be providing an open, free tool, to digitally archive oral traditions, songs, crafts and personal events that are usually passed orally from generation to generation, helping communities connect worldwide.

Even though the idea for Heriga started from the desire to support refugees by recording stories of their route to Europe and the culture they have left behind, it evolved to target a broader audience and hopes to connect people by sharing their history, values and beliefs with the world. It’s about offering them with a sense of identity, belonging and purpose with hopes of facilitating integration and tolerance. The goal is to avoid the loss of people’s heritage and to give communities control of the continuity of their culture to future generations.
