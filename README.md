# Heriga

A platform to record and preserve intangible culture such as stories, legends, memories of culture at risk, working as a social network, shared and managed by communities. This digital archive would also be valuable to register evidence of looting and to store information to safeguard endangered cultural artifacts for future generations. The name of project would be Heriga, which in Arabic means diaspora or exodus. It was inspired by the recent refugee crisis faced by Europe, and I hope to use it to help give voice to the many people displaced by conflict and poverty, so their stories and culture are not lost.
